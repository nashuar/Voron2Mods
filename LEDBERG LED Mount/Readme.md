# IKEA Ledberg Mount

This is a holder for the 4x 24V IKEA Ledberg Spots.

- Print-Settings:
Default Voron2 Parts Print Settings
No Supports needed

- How to install
Put the LED Insert into the mount, rotate it until you can connect the plug and then 
install the complete assembly to the left and right top extrusions. 

I recomment to run the wires through the extrusions and cover it with some extrusion cover inserts.
